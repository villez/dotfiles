Miscellaneous configuration files. Note that zsh configuration is in a separate
repo.

There's no "install" script - yet; the amount of files is small enough
that I'm just symlinking these manually from the home directory when
setting up a new machine/account.

The "osx-customize.sh" is not up to date and I'm not using it
directly; rather, it's just a memory aid for the available/possible
configuration options.
